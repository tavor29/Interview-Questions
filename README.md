# Interview-Questions
I Would like to present a few coding interiew questions that varry in difficulty, starting with the easiest. I will provide an additional more efficeint or difficult solution. 
Hope this will help you code better, and even help land that next job! 

Fizzbuzz:
The first coding problem is an easier one, and perhaps one of the most popular interview questions for junior/entry-level job.



    for i in range(0,100):
    i += 1
    
    if i%3 == 0 and i%5 == 0:
        print("fizzbuzz")
    elif i%3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif i%5 ==0:
        print("Buzz")
    else:
        print(i)
