Fizz buzz:
The task is to code the game Fizzbuzz, using Python.
The rules of the game are:
Count from 1 to 100, while each time n divides by 3 without a reaminder, return "Fizz" instead.
If n/5 without a remainder, it should return "buzz" instead.
If both are possible for n, return "Fizzbuzz".
Here are the best ways to complete the solution in my opinion:
rnge = range(0,30)
for i in rnge:
    i += 1

    if i%3 == 0 and i%5 == 0:
        print("fizzbuzz")
    elif i%3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif i%5 ==0:
        print("Buzz")
    else:
        print(i)
